--QUESTIONS TO BE ANSWERED USING THE ANALYSIS
----1. What is the gender breakdown of employees in the company?
select gender,count(gender) as Countpergender
from hr
group by gender
order by gender

select gender,count(gender) as Countpergender
from hr
where termdate1 > getdate() or termdate1 is null
group by gender
order by gender

----2. What is the race/ethnicity breakdown of employees in the company? -we shall concentreate on the current employees and exclude the fomer ones
select race, count(race) as countperrace
from hr
group by race
order by countperrace desc

select race, count(race) as countperrace
from hr
where termdate1 > getdate() or termdate1 is null
group by race
order by countperrace desc

----3. What is the age distribution of employees in the company?
select min(age) as youngest, max(age) as oldest
from hr
where termdate1 > getdate() or termdate1 is null

----we need to group our ages into different age groups and this will be done in different ways

--a) Using a subquery
select age_group, count(*) as group_count 
from
(
select age,
  case
  when age>=18 and age <=24 then '18-24'
  when age>=25 and age <=34 then '25-34'
  when age>=35 AND age <=44 then '35-44'
  when age>=45 AND age <=54 then '45-54'
  when age>=55 AND age <=64 then '55-64'
  else '65+'
  end as age_group
from hr
where termdate1 > getdate() or termdate1 is null
) as subquery
group by age_group
order by age_group 

--b) Creating a new column called Age group 

alter table hr
add age_group nvarchar(20)

update hr
set age_group =
  case
  when age>=18 and age <=24 then '18-24'
  when age>=25 and age <=34 then '25-34'
  when age>=35 AND age <=44 then '35-44'
  when age>=45 AND age <=54 then '45-54'
  when age>=55 AND age <=64 then '55-64'
  else '65+'
  end

select age_group, count(age_group) as age_groupcount
from hr
where termdate1 > getdate() or termdate1 is null
group by age_group
order by age_group desc

select age_group, gender, count(*) as countofagegrppergender
from hr
where termdate1 > getdate() or termdate1 is null
group by age_group,gender
order by age_group,gender

----4. How many employees work at the headquarters vs remote locations?
select location 
from hr

select location, count(*) as countperlocation
from hr
where termdate1 > getdate() or termdate1 is null
group by location

----5. What is the average length of employment for employees who have been terminated?
select avg(datediff(year,hire_date,termdate1)) as avgyrsofemplymnt
from hr
where termdate1 <= getdate() and termdate1 is not null

-- 6. How does the gender distribution vary across departments?
select department, gender, count(gender) as countdept
from hr
where termdate1 > getdate() or termdate1 is null
group by department,gender
order by department

-- 7. What is the distribution of job titles across the company?
select jobtitle, count(jobtitle) as countjobtitle
from hr
where termdate1 > getdate() or termdate1 is null
group by jobtitle
order by countjobtitle desc

-- 8. Which department has the highest turnover rate?
select department,total_count,terminated_count,(terminated_count *100)/total_count as turnover_rate 
from (
select department,
	count(department) as total_count, sum(case 
	when termdate1 <= getdate() and termdate is not null then 1 else 0 end) as terminated_count
    from hr
    group by department) as subquery
    order by turnover_rate desc

-- 9. What is the distribution of employees across locations by city and state?
select location_state, count(*) as countbystate
from hr
where termdate1 > getdate() or termdate1 is null
group by location_state
order by countbystate desc

-- 10. How has the company's employee count changed over time based on hire and term dates?
select year, hires, terminations, hires-terminations as net_change, (hires-terminations)*100/hires as net_change_percent
from(
select YEAR(hire_date) as year, count(*) as hires, sum(case when termdate1<=getdate() and termdate1 is not null then 1 else 0 end) as terminations
from hr
group by YEAR(hire_date)
) as subquery	
order by year asc

-- 11. What is the tenure distribution for each department?
select department, avg(datediff(year,hire_date,termdate1)) as avgyrsofemplymnt
from hr
where termdate1 <= getdate() and termdate1 is not null
group by department
order by avgyrsofemplymnt desc

-- 12. How many employees have worked with the comapany for each specific number of years?
select datediff(year, hire_date, getdate()) as years_of_service,count(*) as employee_count
